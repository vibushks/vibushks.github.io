This is a webpage designed for the search query wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde.

What we're doing here is a form of SEO contest. While you have great latitude in how you approach this problem, you are not allowed to engage in any unethical or illegal behavior. Please read the discussion of "white hat" versus "black hat" SEO over at Wikipedia.

The only requirement is that somewhere in the page (possibly in the html) you must include your name or some other way for us to identify you (e.g., your gmail username).

Rules of the game:

Your target page may only be a TAMU student page, a page on your own webserver, a page on a standard platform (e.g., GitHub Pages), or some other primarily user-controlled page.
Your target page MAY NOT be a twitter account, a facebook page, a LinkedIn profile, or similar page.
No wikipedia vandalism.
No comment spamming of blogs or news sites.
If you have concerns/questions/clarifications,please post a message to the slack and we will discuss.
